This question refers to the following learning objective(s):

Identify variables as numerical and categorical.

    If variable is numerical, further classify as continuous or discrete based on whether or not the variable can take on an infinite number of values or only non-negative whole numbers, respectively.
    If variable is categorical, determine if it is ordinal based on whether or not the levels have a natural ordering.

Counted data are discrete numerical variables since they can’t take on non-whole values.
